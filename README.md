# Blog-webapp

This is a simple web app made by me while trying to learn EJS templating and working with express.js.
Features include: being able to create posts (It's pretty simple).

I will be working on trying to incorporate database management in the future and will try to deploy it as a complete web app in the future.
To get started, just clone the repository to your device and npm install the packages.
